# About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m **Ramya Vijayakumar**, a law student at **SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur**, pursuing my **BBA LL.B. (Hons.) (2023â€“2028)**.  

I am deeply passionate about **human rights, arbitration, taxation, and international law**. I aspire to use my legal education to contribute meaningfully to society while constantly learning from practical experiences.  

Beyond academics, I enjoy **moot courts, legal research, and presenting papers** on contemporary legal issues. These experiences have sharpened my skills in legal interpretation, advocacy, and public speaking.

## What Drives Me
- A strong belief in justice and fairness  
- A curiosity to explore diverse areas of law  
- The desire to combine legal expertise with social impact

## Outside of Law
When Iâ€™m not buried in case laws or preparing for moot courts, I love reflecting on philosophy, writing, and exploring how law connects with everyday human experiences.
